# Daily chess limit extension
This small browser extension allows to set a limit for your daily games at www.chess.com. After the limit is exceeded, the buttons for starting a new game are disabled.\
The extension is meant for people who often encounter tilt from losing games (just like me or people in [this forum thread](https://www.chess.com/forum/view/general/limit-on-daily-number-of-games)).\
Available for Mozilla Firefox ([link to extension site](https://addons.mozilla.org/cs/firefox/addon/chess-com-limit/)) but could be added also for Google Chrome.
